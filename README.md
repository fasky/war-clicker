# Directions

Eliminate all the enemy tiles.

Click the collect button to collect 1 gold.

A normal tile costs 1 gold, a mine that collects 1 gold every 2 seconds costs 10 gold, and a wall with more health than other tiles costs 20 gold.		

Your color is the one not spreading by itself.

Click to place your color on the map. You can place on enemy tiles adjacent to a friendly tile or on the green land tiles adjacent to a friendly tile.

You can drag the cursor on the map to place as well, as long as you have enough gold.

Change type of tile you place with the drop down menu.

Change scenario to get different starting positions.

Higher difficulty means faster enemy spread rate.
